## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/appointment-scheduler.git
   cd appointment-scheduler
   ```

2. Install all dependencies at once:
   ```
   npm run install-all
   ```

   Or install dependencies separately:

   ```
   # Server dependencies
   cd server
   npm install

   # Client dependencies
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the server directory with the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/appointment-scheduler
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
   EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
   NODE_ENV=development
   TIMEZONE=Your/Timezone  # e.g., 'America/New_York', 'Europe/London', 'Asia/Kolkata'
   ```

   > **Note on Timezones**: The application uses the timezone specified in the `TIMEZONE` environment variable for all date/time operations. If not specified, it defaults to UTC. This is important for appointment scheduling and missed appointment detection. For a list of valid timezone values, refer to the [IANA timezone database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

### MongoDB Setup

You have two options for setting up MongoDB:

1. **Local MongoDB**:
   - For detailed instructions, see [LOCAL_MONGODB_SETUP.md](LOCAL_MONGODB_SETUP.md)
   - **Quick Install Scripts**:
     - Windows: Run `install_mongodb_windows.bat` as administrator
     - macOS/Linux: Run `chmod +x install_mongodb_unix.sh && ./install_mongodb_unix.sh`

2. **MongoDB Atlas**:
   - For detailed instructions, see [MONGODB_SETUP.md](MONGODB_SETUP.md)

### Running the Application

Run both the server and client concurrently:
```
npm run dev
```

Or run them separately:

```
# Start the server
cd server
npm run dev

# Start the client
cd client
npm start
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login a user
- `GET /api/auth/user` - Get current user information

- `GET /api/appointments/:id` - Get specific appointment
- `POST /api/appointments` - Create a new appointment
- `PUT /api/appointments/:id` - Update an appointment
- `DELETE /api/appointments/:id` - Cancel an appointment

### Services
- `GET /api/services` - Get all services
- `GET /api/services/:id` - Get specific service

## Security Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are securely hashed
- **Protected Routes**: API endpoints are protected based on user roles
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized

## Authentication System

The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. Here's how it works:

1. **Token Generation**: When a user logs in or registers, the server generates a JWT token signed with a secret key.
2. **Token Storage**: The token is stored in the browser's localStorage.
3. **Token Usage**: The token is sent with every API request in the Authorization header.
4. **Token Verification**: The server verifies the token's signature and validity before processing requests.

### Preventing Authentication Issues

To ensure smooth authentication across all devices:

1. **Environment Variables**: 
   - Always set the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable in all environments (development, staging, production)
   - Use the same secret value across all environments to maintain token compatibility

2. **Client-Side Storage**: 
   - If users experience login issues, advise them to clear browser cache and local storage
   - Try using incognito/private browsing mode if persistent issues occur

3. **Token Expiration**: 
   - Tokens expire after 30 days by default
   - Users will need to log in again after expiration

For detailed deployment instructions, including setting up authentication properly, refer to the [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md).

## Future Enhancements

- **Payment Integration**: Online payment processing for appointments
- **Video Conferencing**: Built-in video calls for virtual appointments
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile applications for iOS and Android
- **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed business analytics and reporting
- **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization for global users
- **Customer Reviews**: Rating and review system for businesses

## Deployment

This application can be deployed on platforms like Render, Heroku, or Vercel.

### Free Tier Deployment Notes

When deploying on free-tier services (like Render's free tier):

1. **Server Sleep:** Free services typically put your server to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity.
2. **Cold Starts:** When a user visits after inactivity, there's a 30-60 second delay while the server wakes up.
3. **Keep-Alive:** This app includes built-in mechanisms to prevent spin-down:
   - Internal ping service that runs every 14 minutes
   - User-friendly UI that shows "Server is waking up..." during cold starts
   
4. **For more reliable deployments:**
   - Set up an external ping service using [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com) (free)
   - Or upgrade to a paid tier ($7+/month on Render) that doesn't sleep

See `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for detailed information on handling deployment issues.
